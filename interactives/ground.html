<br><strong>I FELL TO THE FLOOR, AND KEPT ON</strong>
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
<br>I fell to the floor and kept falling.
<br> The shore of the ground
<br>
<br> Stopped me, at first,
<br> The way I expected.
<br>
<br> The way the world expects, the way
<br> It had stopped me every time before this.
<br>
<br> But pure mathematics, pure chance,
<br> This one time, this single time,
<br>
<br> Perhaps ever in the history of the world
<br> But having always been possible,
<br>
<br> This one time, something happened:
<br> Something happened in all the broken parts of me,
<br>
<br> All the separate things that combined to be me,
<br> The trillion trillion cells.

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
<br> I could not with my eyes see those cells as broken apart,
<br> But they were some loose confederation
<br>
<br> That made me, some uneasy cells
<br> Holding hands with each other for now.
<br>
<br> This time they spilled through and around and in a heat past
<br> The trillion separate barriers of the ground,
<br>
<br> The ground's cells themselves holding hands only loosely,
<br> All of this a game of Red Rover, all these cells
<br>
<br> Mimicking those Fifties movies of so many people
<br> Going through turnstiles to get into the subway.
<br>
<br> These trillion cells and these trillion barriers
<br> This one time moving easily and quickly by each other,
<br>
<br> Each with its golden ticket, with no need for security,
<br> Each one smiling, each on its way, everything moving.



<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
<br> They passed by each other like water through a grate
<br> In some perverse version of <em>Have a Nice Day</em>.
<br>
<br> each moving in orderly, if rushed, fashion,
<br> Having paid attention during all those fire drills,
<br>
<br> All those things they said: <em> Be calm, leave your stuff. </em>
<br> We&mdash;all the parts of me and All the Parts of the Ground,
<br>
<br> We were matched in our minute mismatch.
<br> I went through and past and by and around and onward
<br>
<br> With nothing to stop me and me polite enough
<br> Not to stop anything going in the other direction,
<br>
<br> Going up, busily going up as I was busily falling,
<br> But falling made new as stepping through the Ground
<br>
<br> Into the outer space of deep underneath,
<br> Into the vast frontier of the spaces-in-between.

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
<br> I had stepped into what had only seemed like darkness, like hardness.
<br> It was as if I had walked into a movie theater,
<br>
<br> Dark already the moment before the movie starts.
<br> I could not see left or right.
<br>
<br> It was a big darkness, wide and deep and high,
<br> An elephant black, a whale black,
<br>
<br> Loam- and oil- and obsidian-colored black.
<br> I felt as if I were falling instead of sitting,
<br>
<br> As if the movie theater seat were suddenly adrift
<br> In a vast water.
<br>
<br> I recognized this place as a dream ground.
<br> I had stood on it before, standing and not standing.
<br>
<br> Here, the sky was full of anti-stars, of also-stars,
<br> Quartz and glass buttons, tin lids and dimes.


<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
<br> Mirror shards and cellophane seen at a distance&mdash;
<br> If this were a dream, all these things combined into what might be stars.
<br>
<br> But they might be stars, the stars of this new place.
<br> These were the stray things that had fallen into the ground
<br>
<br> Before me, but in the same way I had fallen,
<br> The way things fall through a sewer grate
<br>
<br> Far enough that they can't be reached, traveling
<br> By chance, out of hand, too fast, beyond reflex.
<br>
<br> And this might be a dream. But it is not a dream
<br> In that I push something black,
<br>
<br> Something my hands see, push off hard and backward,
<br> My good fortune holding&mdash;
<br>
<br> The same way I fell in, I force myself back out.
<br> The polite passing and exchanging of cells, luckily, still at work.


<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
<br> I am&mdash;just as quickly as it happened&mdash;back on my knees in the kitchen,
<br> My hands firm now on the ground of the floor
<br>
<br> As they have been ten thousand times before.
<br> I get up and dust myself off, shake my head.
<br>
<br> When I fell, gravity called where space did not&mdash;
<br> Space, Up, had never been a friend.
<br>
<br> But falling was easy, comfortable, falling
<br> Toward it, whatever it was, gravity
<br>
<br> That great voice, those  big hands
<br> Waving me in. It was no work or trouble at all.
<br>
<br> I am uneasy, now, and slower in my walk these days.
<br> I trip easily still
<br>
<br> As sometimes I step into the ground
<br> Now that I know the way.
